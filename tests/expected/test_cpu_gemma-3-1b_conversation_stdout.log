    "content": "Okay, here\u2019s a basic recipe for a delicious chocolate cake! It\u2019s a fairly straightforward recipe \u2013 let\u2019s go step-by-step:\n\n**Basic Chocolate Cake**\n\n**Yields:** One 9-inch round cake\n**Prep time:** 20-30 minutes\n**Bake time:** 30-35 minutes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   1 \u00bd cups (192g) all-purpose flour\n*   \u00be cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n*   1 \u00bd cups (300g) granulated sugar\n*   1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder\n*   1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   \u00be cup (177ml) buttermilk (or milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice/vinegar)\n*   \u00be cup (177ml) vegetable oil\n*   2 large eggs\n*   1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   1 cup (240ml) hot coffee (or hot water)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.  You can also line the bottom with parchment paper for easier removal.\n\n2.  **Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n\n3.  **Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.\n\n4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.  Don\u2019t overmix!\n\n5.  **Add Coffee:** Slowly pour in the hot coffee (or hot water) and mix until the batter is smooth.  The batter will be thin \u2013 that\u2019s okay!\n\n6.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\n7.  **Cool:** Let the cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n*   **Don\u2019t overmix:** Overmixing develops gluten, which can make the cake tough.\n*   **Measure accurately:** Baking is a science! Use measuring cups and spoons properly.\n*   **Cool completely:**  Let the cake cool completely before frosting.\n\n**Resources for more detailed instructions and variations:**\n\n*   **Sally\u2019s Baking Addiction:** [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chocolate-cake/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chocolate-cake/)\n*   **Simply Recipes:** [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/chocolate-cake/](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/chocolate-cake/)\n\nTo help me give you more specific advice, could you tell me:\n\n*   What kind of chocolate cake are you hoping to make?
